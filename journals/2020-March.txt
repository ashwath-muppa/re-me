Everything is lonely right now. No one can be together, there's so many rules. I can't even see my friends. The other day, Luke got diagnosed with COVID. He lives right next to me, and now I'm feeling sick. I wonder if I am going to be sick. Is this going to be our life forever?

I feel far more ill now. Things have gotten so much worse. I am lightheaded, can't taste anything, dizzy, short of breath, coughing, wheezing, AND I have a migraine that is unbearable! It's like this virus just won't let up on me. It can't leave me alone.

I feel all alone. I feel like the whole world is doing its thing, while I sit on the side and watch. No one wants to be near me. I am the "monster" since I am the one who will get everyone sick if they go anywhere near me. People even avoid my neighborhood now, they call it COVID alley! Why can't I just live a normal life...
